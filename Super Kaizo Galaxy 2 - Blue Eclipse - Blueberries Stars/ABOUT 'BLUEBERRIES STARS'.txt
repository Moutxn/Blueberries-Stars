 > This version is ONLY meant to be played for the Blue Stars. Please, DO NOT USE THIS VERSION FOR YOUR NORMAL PLAYTHROUGH. Grandmaster and the custom Galaxy are NOT
  changed, so you can play them on this version - 'Blueberries Stars' is meant to give option to skip some harder Galaxies and be closer to one or some of the Blue Stars.

   -> What I mean by that is simple: we will take a quick example - Hightail Falls. Imagine re-doing that Galaxy twice for Blue Star 1 and 2. Are you feeling it? Do you
  feel the insanity? Yeah; I get it. While it "nerfs" the difficulty of those Blue Stars, I do think some people do NOT have the want to re-do such Galaxies. You can now
  understand what Blueberries Stars do.
    It DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING EXCEPT ADDING SOME PIPES*!!! I will list here below the Galaxies/Levels where I did add one or more pipes to give you a quicker access to
  a checkpoint or a Blue Star. You DO NOT have to play this version to do the Blue Stars - if you wanted to do the Blue Stars only, without having done the normal
  Galaxies first, I would advice you not play this version. Blueberries Stars is meant for people who already did the 144 Stars (or tried to get the most they could) and
  don't want to re-do some Galaxies like Hightail Falls, Boss Blitz or GGen.

   * The three exceptions to this rule will be shown this below. In case:
      - Freezy Flake 1 (start).
      - Flash Black 1 (start).
      - Slipsand 1 (middle).



 WORLD 1

  Sky Station -> No pipe added. (Isn't hard/annoying enough imo)

  Yoshi Star -> No pipe added. (Same reasoning)

  Sweet Mystery -> As it's a Ball level, no pipe added. (Already explained)

  Starshine Beach -> No pipe added. (No need for any)

  Haunty Halls -> No pipe added. (While it could get one for Speedy Halls 2, I don't think it's hard enough to justify it - I also put a checkpoint there.)

  Wild Glide -> No pipe added. (The checkpoint at the end is for Blue Star 3 - I don't think there is a need for BS1 or BS2.)

  Fiery Flotilla -> No pipe added. (Too short and easy of a level)

  [CUSTOM GALAXY] -> No pipe added. (No.)

   * Like you can see, no pipe was added to World 1. I do not think anything here deserves pipes.


 WORLD 2

  Throwback -> No pipe added. (A checkpoint was added, so no need)

  Spin-Dig -> No pipe added. (It's not hard enough to deserve it)

  Boulder Bowl -> No pipe added. (Same reasoning, + they are pretty close)

  Fleet Glide -> No pipe added. (Like Wild Glide, the checkpoint is there for a good reason)

  Rightside-Down -> No pipe added. (It's a fun level and not hard enough overall)

  Honeybloom -> One pipe added. (While I didn't want to, I think with how mean BS3 can be, it deserves one)

  Lava Lair -> One pipe added. (The Bowser Statue jump is that hard. Yeah)

   * I hesitated for Honeybloom, but honestly, I get it. Lava Lair was CLEARLY getting a pipe - there was just NO WAY I would have done it.


 WORLD 3

  Fluffy Bluff -> One pipe added. (The long-jump on clouds can be hard, so you can skip it this way)

  Cloudy Court -> No pipe added. (Not hard enough overall)

  Cosmic Cove -> No pipe added. (Not hard enough and they are close enough to you)

  Slimy Spring -> No pipe added. (Come on. It's Slimy Spring.)

  Beat Block -> No pipe added. (While a pretty hard Star overall, adding pipe to such a level feels wrong and can lead to you dying with the gravity)

  Flip-Swap -> No pipe added. (While hard overall, it's not enough for me to give you a pipe)

  Fearsome Fleet -> No pipe added. (Not hard enough overall)

   * Just one pipe, but skipping that long-jump feels fair.


 WORLD 4

  Supermassive -> One pipe added. (Because of how MEAN the BS3 is. Only for that.)

  Freezy Flake* -> No pipe added, but a change was made. (Made you able to spin at the beginning)

  Honeyhop -> One pipe added. (Only because failing the Blue Star 3 can make you feel dead inside)

  Rolling Coaster -> One pipe added. (It's extremely easy, but it can feel boring to do nothing while enjoying the music, ig?)

  Chompworks -> No pipe added. (Seems insane, but I do NOT think it deserves it. The gravity switch at the end is not really that much used for this)

  Tall Trunk -> No pipe added. (Can't find a good place to put one - not hard enough overall for one)

  Gravity Gauntlet -> One pipe added. (Only so you can skip the annoying beginning)

   * Already more pipes overall. It will just get worse, ig? Maybe.


 WORLD 5

  Space Storm -> No pipe added. (No need for any)

  Hightail Falls -> One pipe added. (Of course. This whole version exists BECAUSE of Hightail Falls. lol)

  Upside-Dizzy -> One pipe added. (Because of how MEAN the BS3 is)

  Local Artistic -> No pipe added. (Ball level. I was not nerfing the precised jump, sorry!)

  Mario Squared -> No pipe added. (While very hard, I can't find a good way to put a pipe for Blue Stars)

  Flash Black* -> No pipe added. [Added a lever that you can activate if you want to skip the Star Chips. Optional]

  Boom Bunker -> No pipe added. (While the Comet could deserve one, the time pressure can play around BS3, so...)

    * Only two pipes and an optional addition! And it's World 5! Damn.


 WORLD 6

  Twisty Trials -> Two pipes added. (One for BS1/2 - One for BS3)

  Clockwork Ruins -> No pipe added. (While killing enemies to spawn the Launch Star can be hard, I think it's fine to keep it this way)

  Boss Blitz -> One pipe added. (For all Blue Stars)

  Flipsville -> One pipe added. (Yeah. It's Flipsville. And even with this pipe, it feels horrible - skips the whole Star Chips section)

  Slipsand* -> One pipe added. (To skip the whole beginning - just take it with the fire flower to not have to re-do everything.)
                               [Also made the Launch Star spawn no matter what on the next planet - with it, an Used Block was put to have easier access to it for Blue Star 2.]

  Battle Belt -> No pipe added. (Doesn't need any and it's MOTHER-FUCKING Battle Belt.)

  Galaxy Generator -> Two pipes added. (One for BS2 - One for BS3)

   * World 6 has... a lot of pipes. Clockwork Ruins could have one added and if I didn't love Battle Belt this much, maybe too. Yeah, welcome to World fucking 6.


 WORLD S

  Melty Monster -> One pipe added. (To get to Blue Star 2, in the Chimp Area, quicker)

  Puzzle Plank -> No pipe added. (While I could have made you skip the start, I think it's a nice challenge. No need otherwise!)

  Boo Moon -> One pipe added. (To go to the end for BS2)

  Stone Cyclone -> No pipe needed. (While this Galaxy is PURE insanity, it's too short to have any pipe add-able)

  Shiverburn -> No pipe needed. (No need.)

  Flip-out -> One pipe added. (Only to skip the part after the first pipe, to go on top)

  Grandmaster -> No pipe added. (First of all: No. Then, while I would have loved adding one for BS3, I straight up can't. You will understand why :D)

    * And there you go. Some pipes there and there - Shiverburn maybe could deserve one, but I think most of its difficulty stems from the boss!




 I hope "Blueberries Stars" could be a nice version for you. While some people could be MAD at people using this, as the creator, I will tell you: I don't give two cents.
Re-doing some of these extremely hard levels or annoying to re-do is just... meh. While I think it's part of the challenge, I do not really care for some of them and with
how mean some of them are, just have fun. + if you are like "Oooooh but I want to do them like it sh-" then why did you download this? I am NOT FUCKING AROUND GRRRRRR
I AM GOING TO BITE YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!



 (Other changes:
   -> Sandstorm doesn't have a sandy fog anymore.
   -> Put an arrow + removed a fog area from the Custom Galaxy.
   -> Changed the text from collecting a Grand Star.
   -> View Group of Slipsand BS2 is now "0", so you can see it from anywhere.
   -> Honeyhop Blue Star 3 was put lower to not be TOO annoying anymore (as much as it was funny to ME).
   -> Added an Arrow Sign in Ardor Ship to give a hint on where Blue Star 2 is (otherwise, it's too trial and error to find it).
   -> Remove the "Remove Mario's Cap" Area in Twisty Trials 1/2 to be able to 1st person view.
   -> Changed the place of Blue Star 3 in GGen so you could do it only one way.
   -> Added a Flower Trap under Blue Star 3 of Honeyhop (thanks to The Clanker for the suggestion).
   -> Reduced the fog area in Tall Trunk 2.
   -> Some other changes...~)
